The repository includes the following files:

1. BLRM-Combo-Detox-Trial-Normal.R

This code uploads the required functions and implements the 2BLRM design in the case of dual-agent combination trial continuous doses of M compound. 

This code can be used to produce the performance of the proposed design under the normally distributed doses of M (i.e. results in Table 1)

2. BLRM-Combo-Detox-Trial-Student.R

This code uploads the required functions and implements the 2BLRM design in the case of dual-agent combination trial continuous doses of M compound. 

This code can be used to produce the performance of the proposed design under the t-Student's distribution doses of M (i.e. results in Table 2)
